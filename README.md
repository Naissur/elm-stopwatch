# elm-stopwatch ( [ demo ](http://naissurcoding.com/stopwatch) )

This is a simple stopwatch written in Elm. Being heavily inspired by the idea of functional programming, I decided to give it a try - and found Elm to be a really fun language to write in:)


### Compilation

Install depencencies by running
```bash
elm-package install
npm install
```

To build,
```bash
npm run build
```

For a server with livereload and building on source change, run
```bash
npm run devserver
```
